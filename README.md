### Additional Tips:
- If you're using **Vue CLI** (which is the standard tool for Vue.js), `npm run serve` will run the project in **development mode**. This means that the application will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.
- If you want to build the project for production, you can use:
  ```bash
  npm run build
